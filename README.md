# GovtOS
An open source framework for governance and business.

# Why GovtOS?
It's really difficult to do business in certain countries like India today. Things are stuck in myriad of legacy laws & regulations, and worst of all legacy mindsets. Everyone has an opinion on what works and most importantly what doesn't. People give excuses like when you have billions of people, x doesn't work.
And everyone seems to be complaining about high income taxes, double taxation and what not. On the other hand, cities like Dubai are innovating at huge scale because they have made it super easy to do business.

I wanted to simplify private shares and it turns out certain things are made difficult for a reason.

This lead to the thought that countries itself need to be disrupted. And the best way to do that would be to create a separate country with laws and regulations built from scratch.
Imagine if you could define the terms like governance, taxes, benefits, legal, illegal ...
What would it mean for a country to disallow money laundering, terrorism, cyber bullying etc. Here's a chance to define what these mean in code.


# Benefits

- setting up a legal entity
- depository for shares
- captable tools for allocating shares, recording transactions, allowing freeze / pledge on shares
- ability to dispute things
- 3 factor auth for sensitive things
- legal framework for redressals
- ability to backfix things
- entities for lenders, people, company etc
- simple taxation rules
- bridges for real world
- allow players like Carta, Trica etc to also leverage
